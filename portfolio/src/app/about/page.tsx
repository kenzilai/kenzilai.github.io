                    My journey began with a curious mind in{" "}
                    <b className="text-cyan-500">Game Development</b> and a
                    thirst for knowledge in{" "}
                    <b className="text-cyan-500">Programming</b>. Driven by my
                    passion, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics.

                    <b>But I didn't stop there.</b>
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Recognizing that just the passion and knowledges in Computer
                    Graphics alone weren't sufficient for my goals, so I
                    enrolled in an intensive Coding Bootcamp. Through this
                    experience, I discovered the joy of Web development and
                    realized transferable nature of the programming skill.

                <br />
                <p>
                    Being able to code has enabled me to pursue my interests in
                    Web Development and contribute to Open Source projects while
                    applying my passion to Game development.

                    who I am and the passion I bring to my work.
